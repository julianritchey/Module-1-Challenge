## Overview and Origin

MintGreen is a Canadian cleantech cryptocurrency mining company that was founded in 2017 by Colin Sullivan, Jennifer Zee, Joe Sass and Kurt Melnychuk. Headquartered in Burnaby, British Columbia, the company seeks to make cryptocurrency mining more sustainable and eco-friendly by recovering and distributing the heat generated by the mining process. With a background in heat recovery, CEO Colin Sullivan developed the idea for MintGreen after viewing Bitfury's immersion cooling system in Tbilisi, Georgia. Sullivan described the development of his idea in an interview with Whit Gibbs of Compass Mining:
> We had a client call me one day and basically say, "Hey, we're looking for condensers and a pressure vessel." ... it turned out that this was a mining company, a pretty big one at the time called Bitfury. And they were doing an immersion system in Tbilisi, Georgia, which I got to visit which was incredible. But when I saw it, they were using a system that I thought was pretty inefficient except for just getting rid of heat ... I thought the full value is actually, you know, tying into municipal lines called district energy that heat city blocks ... So, the places you can put this to heat actual blocks at scale, like multi-megawatt, is a massive opportunity particularly when you're supplanting natural gas.

MintGreen has had one seed round, led by Nelson Investments and CoinShares, in which it raised USD 2.5 million.<sup>[[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2)[[3]](#ref3)[[4]](#ref4)</sup>

## Business Activities:

MintGreen is using their proprietary Digital Boilers™ to address ecological concerns faced by two seemingly separate industries. The following is from MintGreen's website<sup>[[1]](#ref1)</sup>:
> MintGreen solves the greatest challenges facing Bitcoin and industrial heating: power costs and sustainability. We use clean energy to mine crypto and heat communities sustainably. We supply industrial partners and district energy utilities with cost leading zero carbon heat from our proprietary Digital Boilers™.

With the increasing global initiative to reduce humanity's carbon footprint, communities and companies are facing increased pressure to find or develop sustainable methods for their activities and services. In October of 2021, Lonsdale Energy Corporation (LEC), the regulated energy provider for the City of North Vancouver in British Columbia, announced they were working with MintGreen to add clean energy to their district energy system. Prior to the announcement, MintGreen had set up two pilot projects, selling waste heat from mining to a sea salt production company for the evaporation of sea water, and to Shelter Point Distillery in Vancouver, British Columbia, for the heating of aging barrels.<sup>[[5]](#ref5)[[6]](#ref6)</sup>

The repurposing of waste heat generated by cryptocurrency mining rigs is not a novel idea. The Norwegian company Kryptovault utilizes waste heat to dry timber; the Swedish company Genesis Mining uses its mining rigs to heat greenhouses. What is novel about MintGreen's approach is the immersion system it has developed to capture the waste heat. MintGreen claims its system can recover more than 96% of the electricity used in the mining process in the form of heat energy; add the statement that MintGreen will not deploy in locations where fossil fuels are the predominant energy source, and its mining process becomes even more sustainable. Because cryptocurrency mining places a constant, consistent load on mining rigs, MintGreen's system can provide companies like LEC with a reliable, year-round, low-carbon heat source.<sup>[[3]](#ref3)[[7]](#ref7)[[8]](#ref8)[[9]](#ref9)</sup>

## Landscape:

As a miner in the blockchain and crypto domain, MintGreen is subject to an ever-changing terrain. Blockchain and crypto have experienced widespread adoption and use by various industries in recent years. For example,
- in Canada, major financial institutions like CIBC utilize a blockchain-based service from SecureKey Technologies Inc. for client identification;
- in England, healthcare patients can utilize a blockchain-based service from Medicalchain SA for sharing and storing personal health records;
- in the United States, companies like Walmart Inc. are utilizing blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric to track the origin and movement of various products.

Some of the other major players in the Canadian blockchain and crypto domain include
- Hut 8, one of the largest mining companies in the world,<sup>[[13]](#ref13)</sup>
- Blockstream, a leading provider of blockchain technologies,<sup>[[14]](#ref14)</sup>
- Blockchain Research Institute, a global community of research professionals.<sup>[[15]](#ref15)</sup>

## Results

MintGreen's renewable energy-powered mining centers are helping businesses and communities lower their carbon footprint, along with cryptocurrency mining as a whole. MintGreen has proven that not only is heat recovery and distribution from the cryptocurrency mining process possible but mining can also serve a two-fold purpose. MintGreen's current 12-year contract with LEC requires the company provide at least 96% of its energy to LEC in the form of heat. If MintGreen meets this demand, it is estimated that its Digital Boilers™ will prevent roughly 20,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere over the term of the contract, when compared to energy supplied by natural gas.<sup>[[4]](#ref4)[[16]](#ref16)</sup>

## Recommendations

While MintGreen's distribution of recovered mining heat to district energy suppliers for residential and commercial heating is already a first of its kind, the idea sets the company up for other potential firsts. One such potential first could be the use of recovered heat for boiling water to supply steam-powered generators. The generators could then feed power back into the local power grid, offsetting some of the mining center's power consumption. If the mining centers are located near hydroelectric generation facilities, there would be an ample supply of power and water for the mining and steam generation process. In terms of energy usage, this idea would benefit no entity other than MintGreen, though it could provide them with inexpensive power for mining endeavours.

Another potential first could be the development of point-of-use heating-and-mining devices. These devices could utilize a throttle mechanism that turns individual mining units on and off based on feedback from a thermostat. The devices could also be adapted to provide cooling through a heat-powered refrigeration system, much like gas-powered refrigerators. In addition to earning mined cryptocurrency, MintGreen could lease these units at low costs to end-users, reducing users' utility costs and carbon footprint, and potentially earning them carbon credits (depending on the location of use). These point-of-use devices could provide alternative heating and cooling services to locations not tied into a district energy system.
