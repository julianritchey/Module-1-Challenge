# MintGreen: Redefining mining, in a sustainable manner.

## Overview and Origin

MintGreen is a Canadian cleantech cryptocurrency mining company that was founded in 2017 in Burnaby, British Columbia. With a background in heat recovery, Colin Sullivan, along with co-founding members Jennifer Zee, Joe Sass and Kurt Melnychuk, sought to make cryptocurrency mining more sustainable and eco-friendly by recovering and distributing the heat generated by the mining process. MintGreen has had one seed round, led by Nelson Investments and CoinShares, in which it raised USD 2.5 million.<sup>[[1]](https://mintgreen.co/)[[2]](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mintgreen)[[3]](https://www.vantechjournal.com/p/mintgreen-north-vancouver)[[4]](https://compassmining.io/education/mint-green-bitcoin-mining-podcast/)</sup>

## Business Activities:

MintGreen is using their proprietary Digital Boilers™ to address ecological concerns faced by two seemingly separate industries. The following is from MintGreen's website<sup>[[1]](https://mintgreen.co/)</sup>:
> MintGreen solves the greatest challenges facing Bitcoin and industrial heating: power costs and sustainability. We use clean energy to mine crypto and heat communities sustainably. We supply industrial partners and district energy utilities with cost leading zero carbon heat from our proprietary Digital Boilers™.

With the increasing global initiative to reduce humanity's carbon footprint, communities and companies are facing increased pressure to find or develop sustainable methods for their activities and services. In October of 2021, Lonsdale Energy Corporation (LEC), the regulated energy provider for the City of North Vancouver in British Columbia, announced they were working with MintGreen to add clean energy to their district energy system. Prior to the announcement, MintGreen had set up two pilot projects, selling waste heat from mining to a sea salt production company and to Shelter Point Distillery in Vancouver, British Columbia.<sup>[[5]](https://www.cnv.org/Business-Development/Lonsdale-Energy/Latest-News-and-Updates)[[6]](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/miningweek/2022/03/24/7-wild-bitcoin-mining-rigs/)</sup>

The repurposing of waste heat generated by cryptocurrency mining rigs is not a novel idea. The Norwegian company Kryptovault utilizes waste heat to dry timber; the Swedish company Genesis Mining uses its mining rigs to heat greenhouses. What is novel is the immersion system MintGreen has developed to capture the waste heat in their Digital Boilers™. MintGreen claims their system can recover more than 96% of the electricity used in the mining process in the form of heat energy. Because cryptocurrency mining places a constant, consistent load on mining rigs, MintGreen's system can provide companies like LEC with a reliable, year-round heat source.<sup>[[3]](https://www.vantechjournal.com/p/mintgreen-north-vancouver)[[7]](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-heat-capture-startup-mintgreen-closes-seed-financing-round)[[8]](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-environmental-debate-is-wrong)</sup>

## Landscape:

As a miner in the blockchain and crypto domain, MintGreen is subject to an ever-changing terrain. Blockchain and crypto have experienced widespread adoption and use by various industries in recent years. In Canada, major financial institutions like CIBC utilize a blockchain-based service from SecureKey Technologies Inc. for client identification; in England, healthcare patients can utilize a blockchain-based service from Medicalchain SA for sharing and storing personal health records; in the United States, companies like Walmart are utilizing blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric to track the origin and movement of various products.<sup>[[9]](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/canadas-big-5-banks-launch-blockchain-based-digital-identity-service-with-securekey/417406)[[10]](https://medicalchain.com/en/)[[11]](https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/walmart-case-study)</sup>
