## Overview and Origin

MintGreen is a Canadian cleantech cryptocurrency mining company that was founded in 2017 by Colin Sullivan, Jennifer Zee, Joe Sass and Kurt Melnychuk. Headquartered in Burnaby, British Columbia, the company seeks to make cryptocurrency mining more sustainable and eco-friendly by recovering and distributing the heat generated by the mining process. With a background in heat recovery, CEO Colin Sullivan developed the idea for MintGreen after viewing Bitfury's immersion cooling system in Tbilisi, Georgia. Sullivan described the development of his idea in an interview with Whit Gibbs of Compass Mining:<sup>[[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2)[[3]](#ref3)</sup>
> We had a client call me one day and basically say, "Hey, we're looking for condensers and a pressure vessel." ... it turned out that this was a mining company, a pretty big one at the time called Bitfury. And they were doing an immersion system in Tbilisi, Georgia, which I got to visit which was incredible. But when I saw it, they were using a system that I thought was pretty inefficient except for just getting rid of heat ... I thought the full value is actually, you know, tying into municipal lines called district energy that heat city blocks ... So, the places you can put this to heat actual blocks at scale, like multi-megawatt, is a massive opportunity particularly when you're supplanting natural gas.

MintGreen has had one seed round, led by Nelson Investments and CoinShares, in which it raised USD 2.5 million.<sup>[[4]](#ref4)</sup>

## Business Activities

MintGreen is using its proprietary Digital Boilers™ to address ecological concerns faced by two seemingly separate industries. The following is from MintGreen's website:<sup>[[1]](#ref1)</sup>
> MintGreen solves the greatest challenges facing Bitcoin and industrial heating: power costs and sustainability. We use clean energy to mine crypto and heat communities sustainably. We supply industrial partners and district energy utilities with cost leading zero carbon heat from our proprietary Digital Boilers™.

With the increasing global initiative to reduce humanity's carbon footprint, communities and companies are facing increased pressure to find or develop sustainable methods for their activities and services. In October of 2021, Lonsdale Energy Corporation (LEC), the regulated energy provider for the City of North Vancouver in British Columbia, announced they were working with MintGreen to add clean energy to their district energy system. Regarding the process, LEC stated the following:<sup>[[5]](#ref5)</sup>
> MintGreen will be operating a data computing operation which results in waste heat being generated. LEC will be recovering this heat and injecting it into LEC’s heating grid. For clarity, LEC is not involved in the data computing process; LEC is solely recovering otherwise wasted heat.

Prior to the announcement, MintGreen had set up two pilot projects, selling waste heat from mining to a sea salt production company for the evaporation of sea water, and to Shelter Point Distillery in Vancouver, British Columbia, for the heating of aging barrels.<sup>[[6]](#ref6)</sup>

The repurposing of waste heat generated by cryptocurrency mining rigs is not a novel idea. The Norwegian company Kryptovault utilizes waste heat to dry timber; the Swedish company Genesis Mining uses its mining rigs to heat greenhouses. What is novel about MintGreen's approach is the proprietary immersion system it has developed to capture the waste heat. MintGreen claims its system can recover more than 96% of the electricity used in the mining process in the form of heat energy; add the statement that MintGreen will not deploy in locations where fossil fuels are the predominant energy source, and its mining process becomes even more sustainable. Because cryptocurrency mining places a constant, consistent load on mining rigs, MintGreen's system can provide companies like LEC with a reliable, year-round, low-carbon heat source.<sup>[[3]](#ref3)[[7]](#ref7)[[8]](#ref8)[[9]](#ref9)</sup>

## Landscape

As a miner in the blockchain and crypto domain, MintGreen is subject to an ever-changing terrain. Blockchain and crypto have experienced widespread adoption and use by various industries in recent years. For example,
- in Canada, major financial institutions like CIBC utilize a blockchain-based service from SecureKey Technologies Inc. for client identification;<sup>[[10]](#ref10)</sup>
- in England, healthcare patients can utilize a blockchain-based service from Medicalchain SA for sharing and storing personal health records;<sup>[[11]](#ref11)</sup>
- in the United States, companies like Walmart Inc. are utilizing blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric to track the origin and movement of various products from around the world;<sup>[[12]](#ref12)</sup>
- in El Salvador, Bitcoin has been adopted as legal tender.[[13]](#ref13)</sup>

This adoption has not been without its difficulties, though, especially in the mining sector. With the high energy demand required by proof-of-work systems, countries like China have placed heavy restrictions and bans on local mining operations. These restrictions and bans have forced many mining companies to move their operations to other countries. Some examples are
- Bit Mining Ltd., who moved much of their operation to Kazakhstan, and have invested in a mining center in Texas;<sup>[[14]](#ref14)
- Poolin, who moved much of their operation to Texas;<sup>[[15]](#ref15)
- Bitmain, who have expanded their facility in Texas.<sup>[[15]](#ref15)

While MintGreen's approach to green mining is one-of-a-kind, the company is not alone in its use of sustainable energy.
- American company EZ Blockchain, LLC has developed portable mining containers that it ships to rural industrial sites, like solar farms and wind farms, to convert wasted energy into profit. One such process is the capturing of burnoff from flare stacks at oil and gas facilities to produce electrical energy to power the mining containers.<sup>[[16]](#ref16)
- Canadian company Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. utilizes renewable hydroelectricity for its data and mining centers in Canada and Sweden. In Iceland the company adds geothermal energy to its electricity source.<sup>[[17]](#ref17)</sup>
- The government of El Salvador utilizes geothermal energy for its mining center, located at the base of a volcano.<sup>[[18]](#ref18)</sup>

When it comes to the blockchain and crypto domain as a whole, Canada is quickly becoming home to some major players. Some of the large blockchain companies that call Canada home include
- Hut 8, one of the largest mining companies in the world,<sup>[[19]](#ref19)</sup>
- Blockstream, a leading provider of blockchain technologies (and whose former CSO, Samson Mow, is now a Bitcoin advisor for MintGreen),<sup>[[20]](#ref20)</sup>
- Blockchain Research Institute, a global community of research professionals.<sup>[[21]](#ref21)</sup>

## Results

MintGreen's renewable energy-powered mining centers are helping businesses and communities lower their carbon footprint, along with cryptocurrency mining as a whole. MintGreen has proven that not only is heat recovery and distribution from the cryptocurrency mining process possible but mining can also serve a two-fold purpose.

Moving forward, MintGreen's key performance indicators will be the following:

- Percentage of energy recovered.

    MintGreen claims its system can recover 96% of the energy used in the cryptocurrency mining process. The company will need to ensure its systems maintain this target as a minimum. Regarding the company's current 12-year contract with LEC, Sullivan has stated:<sup>[[4]](#ref4)[[22]](#ref22)</sup>
    > In our work, we're contractually obligated to provide 96% of our energy in the form of heat. We think we can do better than that.

- Greenhouse gases (GHGs) prevented.

    As a sustainable and eco-friendly business, one of MintGreen's focuses is the reduction of carbon footprints. If MintGreen meets its contractual demands from LEC, it is estimated that its Digital Boilers™ will prevent roughly 20,000 tonnes of GHGs per megawatt of energy from entering the atmosphere when compared to energy supplied by natural gas. Though only an estimated value, the prevention of GHG emissions can result in businesses and communities achieving carbon footprint-reduction goals and, where applicable, earning tax credits.<sup>[[22]](#ref22)</sup>

- Price of energy sold

    While green energy is already a selling point for MintGreen's systems, another enticing feature is the price for its energy. Because MintGreen is recovering energy used in another process, they are able to sell this energy at lower-than-average prices. According to Meltem Demirors, investor in MintGreen and Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares:<sup>[[9]](#ref9)</sup>
    > MintGreen can say with confidence, at least in British Columbia, that they are the lowest priced low carbon heat source for district energy.

- Overall revenue

    MintGreen earns revenue from multiple avenues:
    
    1. Mining of cryptocurrencies.
    
        Revenue earned from mining is highly profitable when combined with offtake agreements.<sup>[[9]](#ref9)</sup>
        
    2. Sale of recovered energy.
    
        Though recovered energy can be sold at low prices while still being profitable, carbon-regulated markets allow MintGreen to sell its greener solution for much higher.<sup>[[3]](#ref3)</sup>
    
    3. Tax credits.
    
        Being a Canadian business, MintGreen is eligible for the tax credits available for green solutions. Though many of the applicable tax credits for installed systems would be provided to the companies utilizing MintGreen's systems to offset their carbon footprint, MintGreen could still be eligible for tax credits in some scenarios.<sup>[[9]](#ref9)</sup>

## Recommendations

While MintGreen's distribution of recovered mining heat to district energy suppliers for residential and commercial heating is already a first of its kind, the idea sets the company up for other potential firsts. One such potential first could be the use of recovered heat for boiling water to supply steam-powered generators. The generators could then feed power back into the local power grid, offsetting some of the mining center's power consumption. If the mining centers are located near hydroelectric generation facilities, there would be an ample supply of power and water for the mining and steam generation process. In terms of energy usage, this idea would benefit no entity other than MintGreen, though it could provide them with inexpensive power for mining endeavours.

Another potential first could be the development of point-of-use heating-and-mining devices. These devices could utilize a throttle mechanism that turns individual mining units on and off based on feedback from a thermostat. The devices could also be adapted to provide cooling through a heat-powered refrigeration system, much like gas-powered refrigerators. In addition to earning mined cryptocurrency, MintGreen could lease these units at low costs to end-users, reducing users' utility costs and carbon footprint, and potentially earning them tax credits (depending on the location of use). These point-of-use devices could provide alternative heating and cooling services to locations not tied into a district energy system.
